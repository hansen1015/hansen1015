# 👋 Hi, I’m Hansen (@Hansen1015)

### 🚀 Aspiring Hardware Engineer | Aerospace Engineering Student

I’m a builder who lives at the intersection of **Aerospace Engineering** and **IoT**. Whether it's optimizing a Formula Student vehicle, managing power with BMS, or coding ESP32s for niche e-ink displays, I’m always tinkering with things that fly, drive, or connect.

### 🛠️ The Workbench
- **Focus:** Electronics, IoT, and Embedded Systems.
- **Languages & Tools:** ![Arduino](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Arduino-00979D?style=flat&logo=Arduino&logoColor=white) 
  ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/-C++-00599C?style=flat&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)
  ![ESP32](https://img.shields.io/badge/-ESP32-E7352C?style=flat&logo=espressif&logoColor=white)
- **Current Interests:** Battery Management Systems (BMS), Formula Student telemetry, and 3D printing custom RC components.

### 🔋 Featured Project: GeekMagic_Calendar
> **[Check out the repo here!](https://github.com/Hansen1015/GeekMagic_Calendar)**
> A custom implementation for the GeekMagic / Xteink X4 hardware. Bringing Google Calendar events to a tiny, desk-friendly E-Ink display via ESP32.

### 🏎️ Formula Student & Aero
When I'm not coding, I'm applying physics and engineering principles to:
- **Aerospace Engineering:** Understanding the "why" behind the flight.
- **Formula Student:** Designing and testing high-performance systems.
- **BMS:** Making sure the juice stays where it belongs.

### 🕹️ When the Laptop Closes...
- ✈️ **RC Airplanes:** If it has wings, I’ll try to fly it.
- 🖨️ **3D Printing:** Turning CAD dreams into plastic reality.
- 🧪 **Experimental stuff:** Always testing new sensors or mechanical designs.
